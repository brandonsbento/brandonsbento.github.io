  I have so much more space now that these walls are walls and not pieces of wood on the floor.
  I managed to put up about half of the walls this weekend before my batteries died on the tools I'm using.

  <br><br>

  To begin with, I installed furring strips on every aluminum stiffener in the box.
  These furring strips are the structural elements to which I'll attach the walls and likely any particularly-heavy later installations (like a Murphy bed).
  Most of the stiffeners got 1" furring strips, but those stiffeners at which two wall panels meet got a 3" furring strip.

  <br><br>

  <br><br>

  Once the furring strips were in, I was able to cut the 1/2" plywood to size and secure it to the furring strips.
  Reducing weight is the name of the game (praying for manageable gas mileage), so why use 1/2" walls?
  Well:
  <ul>
    <li>I want to attach things directly to the walls. If I used anything thinner than 1/2" it wouldn't be possible. Attaching to the furring strips as a requirement just seemed like a pain in my future ass.</li>
    <li>I want the walls to feel solid. If I'm afraid to lean against the wall for fear of breaking it, that's not a wall -- that's a tissue.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <img src="walls_side_1.jpeg" width="900" alt="Mind the gaps. Or don't, I'm adding trim eventually.">
  
  <br><br>

  I started with the wall attached to the cab and then did the left side wall. 
  Unfortunately, that's all the further I got this weekend.
  The entire right side of the truck is still just furring strips and insulation since my tools ran out of batteries.

  <br><br>

  <img src="walls_side_2.jpeg" width="900" alt="you_didnt_see_anything_penguins.jpeg">
  
  <br><br>

  Speaking of battery powered tools, for this entire conversion, I have the following power tools.
  They are all battery powered and all Hyper Tough (Walmart) brand.
  They've been working great! 
  <ul>
    <li>Circular saw</li>
    <li>Jigsaw</li>
    <li>Impact driver</li>
    <li>Drill</li>
  </ul>

  I also make extensive use of the following (arguably) unpowered tools.
  <ul>
    <li>Clamps</li>
    <li>Speed square</li>
    <li>Framing square</li>
    <li>Tape measure</li>
    <li>Pocket knife</li>
    <li>Google Drawings</li>
    <li>Among various other items.</li>
  </ul>

  With half of the walls up, the next thing to sort out is... putting the other half of the walls up. 
  After that though, I'll probably:
  <ol>
    <li>Paint the ceiling.</li>
    <li>Paint the walls.</li>
    <li>Build various things in ambiguous order, including</li>
    <ul>
      <li>A Murphy bed.</li>
      <li>Storage places.</li>
      <li>A couch.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Install the floors.</li>
    <li>Worry about the various long-time-horizon items I'm imagining, including</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Electricity and solar power.</li>
      <li>Water, plumbing, and shower.</li>
      <li>A kitchen counter with sink, stove, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>

  <br><br>

  So anyway, as you can imagine it's going to take me a long time to finish this since I pretty much only get to work on it on weekends.
  Stay tuned for more updates!

  Today I spent a lot of time planning, so not much actual progress to speak of. 
  I was able to install a small number of furring strips on the walls of the truck in preparation for installing the actual walls. 
  I mostly use Google Drawings to plan out the conversion; it works surprisingly well.

  <br>
  <br>

  Here is a view of the side walls and cab-attached wall of the truck.
  This shows the dimensions I'll need, and I end up using it as a cut list too.
  It was super helpful this time around since the structural aluminum beams are not spaced uniformly.

  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>

  Tomorrow is Monday, and I work a lot.
  It's pretty likely that there won't be any further conversion progress until next weekend.
</p>

  <h3>No.</h3>
  
  Despite having the box truck for a few months now and living in it for the past month and a bit, I haven't actually made a ton of progress on it.
  At this point, the things I've accomplished include:

  <h3>Registration (a painful process -- thanks, DMV!)</h3>

  Registration was a major pain.
  The DMV told me that I need to get the vehicle inspected to prove that it has been converted to a motorhome, but when I bought it it was just an empty box truck. 
  TL;DR I rushed to "convert" it, it looked like garbage, the DMV said "Oh you don't need an inspection", and now it's registered.
  What a pain.

  <h3>Floor insulation and subfloor installation</h3>

  I used 1.5 inch foam insulation spaced between 2x4s for the floor insulation.
  On top of that I installed plywood that I cut down to the width of the box.
  The gapping is pristine, if I do say so myself.

  <h3>Wall and ceiling insulation</h3>

  Thinsulate is dope.
  Easy to work with, easy to cut to size, and decent insulation value.
  I covered all the walls and ceiling in 2 inch thinsulate.
  
  <br>
  <br>

  At this point I was living in the truck full time, so lots of my stuff is scattered everywhere in these pics.

  <h3>Ceiling panel installation</h3>

  Working alone overhead with 4 ft x ~8 ft panels is a ton of fun.
  I highly recommend it.

<p>
  I bought a box truck, and I'm turning it into an RV, sort of.
  Hopefully I'll update this website reasonably often, but who knows.
  Anyway, here's a picture of what I lovingly call the bento box.
